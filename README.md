# reactjs-weather-panel

Simple small site that shows the current weather in an entered city just to test my skills. 
I went through a few dead ends. 
The layout is probably the best on a tablet.
It uses React, Typescript, SCSS, BEM, GraphQL.

The weather data are loaded by GraphQL API from
https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/graphql-weather-api

Live demo find on https://reactjs-weather-panel.vercel.app/
